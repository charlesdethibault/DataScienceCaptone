# DataScienceCaptone

This is the Capstone Project for the Data Science Specialisation from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera. The objective was to digest a raw dataset from blogs, news and twitter to be able to build a model that should predict the next word you are about to write given the last words written. The app is using a simple Katz Back Off model to predict the next word

App is accessible here : https://charlesdethibault.shinyapps.io/Swift2/
